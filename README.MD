# Learn PostgreSQL 🐘

This repository is my personal practice space for learning **PostgreSQL** — from creating tables and relationships to writing queries using **JOIN**, **GROUP BY**, **MAX**, and more.

## 📚 What I’m Learning

- 🧱 Creating tables and defining data types
- 🔗 Setting up relationships with `FOREIGN KEY`
- 🧮 Using aggregate functions like `MAX`, `COUNT`, and `SUM`
- 🤝 Joining multiple tables (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.)
- 📆 Working with dates and numerical data
- 🧠 Writing queries to extract meaningful insights
